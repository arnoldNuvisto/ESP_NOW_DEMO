This project demonstrates ESP-NOW running on a network of ESP-32 development boards.

Some of the project's features:

- Auto-Discovery & Auto-Pairing
- Auto-Recovery on re-start
- Connects up to 20 devices*
- Allows for two-way communication
- Optional key-encrypted messages
- Does not require access to a WiFi router 
- Does not use BlueTooth
- Utilizes task scheduling to control operations
- Allows for extensive device configuration & management

How to run this demo:

- Download the repo & open it with VSCode & PlatformIO
- Connect & flash the first ESP32 module
- Disconnect & set aside this module - it will act as a HUB
- Goto line #30 in the code and comment out "#define _HUB_"
- Connect & flash the second ESP32 module
- Disconnect & set aside this module - it will act as a NODE
- Repeat the last 2 steps for up to 19 additional NODEs
- Power-up & open a serial monitor for the HUB
- One-by-one, power-up & open a serial monitor for each NODE
- View the dialogue between devices in the serial monitors

Also:

- Uncommenting "#define _SECURE_" will force key encryption of messages*
- Uncommenting "#define _RESET_NVM" will clear out non-volatile memory
- Uncommenting "#define _RETAIN_MSG_" well set a retain flag on messages (used with MQTT)

* Can connect up 6 devices when key-encryption is enabled.
